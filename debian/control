Description: Implements the server side of the SPICE protocol
 The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is
 a remote display system built for virtual environments which allows
 you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine
 where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide
 variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package contains the run-time libraries for any application that 
 wishes to be a SPICE server.
