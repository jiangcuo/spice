Subject: link libspice server with libm libpthread
From: Michael Tokarev <mjt@tls.msk.ru>
Forwarded: yes

Upstream makefile apparently forgot to link libspice-server
with -lm -lpthread -- it uses symbols from these libraries.
These libs are detected by configure and stored in
$(SPICE_NONPKGCONFIG_LIBS) make variable, but this variable
is never referenced.  Add it to server/Makefile.am.
